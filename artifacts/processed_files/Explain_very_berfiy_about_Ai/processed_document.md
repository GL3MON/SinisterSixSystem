## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field of computer science focused on developing machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. The fundamental goal of AI is to enable systems to learn, reason, perceive, understand language, and solve problems autonomously, mimicking cognitive functions.

At its core, AI involves creating algorithms and models that can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, make decisions, and adapt over time. This encompasses various sub-fields like machine learning (where systems learn from data without explicit programming), natural language processing (for understanding and generating human language), and computer vision (for interpreting visual information). Ultimately, AI aims to augment human capabilities, automate complex processes, and drive innovation across virtually every sector.
