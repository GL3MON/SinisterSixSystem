This document provides a comprehensive tutorial for a Grade 10 algebra problem involving quadratic equations. The aim is to enhance understanding of quadratic functions in real-world contexts.

Quadratic equations are fundamental in algebra and have numerous applications in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields. In Grade 10, students typically learn to solve quadratic equations by factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. They also learn to interpret the graphs of quadratic functions, which are parabolas, and identify key features such such as the vertex and intercepts.

A quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree two. Its general form involves a term with $x^2$, a term with $x$, and a constant, where the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is not zero. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. If the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point (vertex). If it is positive, it opens upwards, indicating a minimum point.

For a quadratic function, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex (the point where the function reaches its maximum or minimum value) can be found using a specific formula. Once the $x$-coordinate is found, substitute it back into the function to find the corresponding $y$-coordinate (the maximum or minimum value).

The roots (or zeros) of a quadratic equation are the values of $x$ for which the function equals zero. These can be found using the quadratic formula. The term known as the discriminant determines the nature of the roots.
