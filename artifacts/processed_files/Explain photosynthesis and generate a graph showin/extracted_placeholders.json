The X-axis should be labeled \"Light Intensity (arbitrary units)\" and the Y-axis \"Rate of Photosynthesis (arbitrary units)\". The curve should start at the origin, increase linearly at first, then gradually level off into a plateau, indicating that at higher light intensities, another factor (like CO2 concentration or temperature) becomes limiting."
