# Introduction to Linear Equations

Welcome to this lesson on linear equations! In Grade 10 algebra, understanding linear equations is fundamental. A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term has an exponent of 1, and when graphed, it forms a straight line. They are incredibly useful for modeling real-world situations, from calculating distances and speeds to determining costs and profits.

Our goal when solving a linear equation in one variable is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. This often involves isolating the variable on one side of the equation using inverse operations. For linear equations in two variables, we can represent their relationship visually on a coordinate plane.

# Concept Explanation: What is a Linear Equation?

A linear equation in one variable can generally be written in a form where the variable has an exponent of 1. The variable is typically represented by a letter like x.

## Solving

To solve for the variable, we use inverse operations:
*   Add or subtract terms to get all terms with the variable on one side and constant terms on the other.
*   Multiply or divide to isolate the variable.

## Linear Equations in Two Variables

An equation that represents a linear relationship between two variables, typically x and y, describes a straight line. When plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system, all points that satisfy the equation lie on a straight line.
